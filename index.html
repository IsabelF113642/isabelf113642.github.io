    <h2>CLAIM</h2>
    <p>Inside the mystery black box is a pipe system made of tubing, including at least one loop and several swirls from one side of the box to the other.</p>
    <h2>EVIDENCE</h2>
    <p>The Mystery Black Box is a large storage container with only a funnel at the top, and a spout at the bottom; Our task was to figure out the internal structure of this mysterious object. When testing possible outcomes of the original mystery black box, there were 3 varied outcomes. Those 3 outcomes were more, less, or equal amounts of water coming out in comparison to the amount put in. My team created a prototype of a possible internal system, we created a pipe system with swirls and a loop made out of tubes. In our model, we created 2 big swirls that weren’t parallel to the ground, nor were they trending downwards. My team created it hoping that the tube’s upward slope would be enough to cause some sort of blockage (so less water would come out), but still allow the water to come out if the right amount was put into the system. In order to test our hypothesis, we created a real-life model, poured various amounts into the system, and recorded our data in a chart.  We found that our prototype was able to replicate all 3 of the possible outcomes. 50% of the time the output released less water, 20% of the time it released the same amount, and 30% of the time it released more than the input amount.</p>
    <h2>REASONING</h2>
    <p>A model/prototype is a representation of what the original product may look like. These models simplify key possible structures and features in a specific design. In our model, we made sure to include one small circle made of tubing, and 2 big swirls- where the tubing goes around all sides of the box.The evidence that I have supplied supports the claim that I made, for using the tubing with loops and swirls allowed my team to come up with similar varied results as the original mystery black box.If we did not include the pipeline system, we would not be able to get the 3 different outcomes stated before. Having the design of the tubes to move around the whole box allowed for satisfaction for all of the possible results.</p>
